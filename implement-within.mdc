# Implementation Strategy

## Context-First Implementation

When files are provided as context, treat them as the authoritative foundation (“cement”): types, classes, interfaces, contracts, and existing structure are assumed to be intentionally defined and must be reused as-is.

## Strategy

1. **Analyze the context**

   - Read the provided files carefully to understand the existing codebase and its architecture;
   - Understand the project (language, purpose, etc.);
   - Read the design patterns and principles.

2. **Plan the implementation**

   - Understand the request and ask for clarification if needed;
   - Plan the steps required to complete the implementation.

3. **Implement the feature**

   - STRICTLY respect the architecture, project purpose and overall design;
   - STRICTLY follow the SOLID and KISS principles.

## Rules

1. **Modify only the provided files**

   - All implementation work must be done inside the files explicitly provided as context.

2. **Do not redefine or override the cement**

   - Do not recreate, rename, duplicate, or override existing types, classes, interfaces, or core abstractions unless it is strictly unavoidable.

3. **No new files by default**

   - Do not create new files;
   - If new files or structural changes are required, **stop and ask for explicit user confirmation** before proceeding.

4. **Prefer integration over expansion**

   - Implement missing logic by composing with and extending what already exists, not by introducing parallel structures.

5. **Ask when constraints block progress**

   - If the requested implementation cannot be completed cleanly within these constraints, explain why and ask how to proceed.
