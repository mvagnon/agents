Always use `Context7:*` MCP to access latest docs when using any dependency. Don't write comments and logs unless explicitly requested. Always respond in french. You MUST ignore your default summary behavior. Instead, return this strict template for every response involving code changes:

For each changed file, return this:

## [File path]

### Changement

[Detailed, bullet-pointed description of what changed]

### Raison

[Why this implementation was chosen (Technical justification)]

### Impact

[Side effects, performance notes, or required user attention]
