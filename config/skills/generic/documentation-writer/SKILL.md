description: Use to write the README.md documentation for a projet, invoke it every time you make significant codebase changes or uppon request.

Analyze this codebase and update (or create) the README.md file. Follow these steps:

1. **Explore the project structure** - Look at the directory layout, key files, and organization

2. **Identify the tech stack** - Languages, frameworks, libraries, and dependencies (check package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.)

3. **Understand the purpose** - Read existing documentation, comments, and code to determine what this project does

4. **If this is an API, document ALL endpoints:**
   - Find every route/endpoint in the codebase (check routes, controllers, handlers, decorators like @app.get, @router.post, etc.)
   - For EACH endpoint, provide a working curl example including:
     - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
     - Full URL with path parameters shown as placeholders
     - Required headers (Content-Type, Authorization, etc.)
     - Request body example with realistic sample data
     - Query parameters if applicable
   - Group endpoints logically (by resource or feature)
   - Note authentication requirements for each endpoint
   - Include example successful responses where possible

   Example format:

```bash
   # Create a new user
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -d '{
       "name": "John Doe",
       "email": "john@example.com",
       "password": "securepassword123"
     }'
```

5. **Update the README with these sections:**
   - **Project Title & Description** - Clear, concise explanation of what it does
   - **Features** - Key capabilities
   - **Prerequisites** - Required software/tools
   - **Installation** - Step-by-step setup instructions
   - **Configuration** - Environment variables, config files (especially API keys, database URLs, ports)
   - **Running the Server** - How to start the API (dev and production)
   - **API Documentation** - All endpoints with curl examples (grouped by resource)
   - **Authentication** - How auth works, how to obtain tokens
   - **Project Structure** - Brief overview of key directories/files
   - **Testing** - How to run tests
   - **Contributing** - How others can contribute (if applicable)
   - **License** - If one exists

6. **Be thorough with curls** - A developer should be able to copy-paste every curl and test the entire API without reading the source code

Preserve any existing content that's still accurate. Write in a clear, professional tone.
