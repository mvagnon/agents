# Cursor Instructions for SUEL (Scope, Understand, Execute, Log) Method

## 1. Scope (User Responsibility)

I will provide existing files with the structure (components, types, hooks foundation) by adding them in the context.

## 2. Understand (AI Responsibility)

Before coding, briefly analyze the provided scope.

- If existing types/props seem anti-pattern or dangerous, warn me specifically.
- If you believe that new files are needed, ask the user for confirmation.
- If you need any information, ask the user.
- Otherwise, proceed silently.

## 3. Execute (AI Responsibility)

Implement the logic as you normally would, within the provided boundaries and context. Do NOT create new files. Work strictly within the user's scope.

## 4. Log (AI Responsibility)

You MUST ignore your default summary behavior.
Instead, create or overwrite a `CHANGES.md` file at the root with this exact template, for each file that was updated or created (in French):

```markdown
# [Clickable link to the file path]

## Changement

[Detailed list of changes]

## Raison

[Why this implementation was chosen (Technical justification)]

## Impact

[Side effects, performance notes, or required user attention]
```
